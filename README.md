# VIT Bhopal Campus Course & Records Manager (CCRM)

CCRM is a powerful, yet easy-to-use Java console application designed to manage student records, courses, enrollments, and grades specifically for VIT Bhopal University. This isn't just a simple student tracker; CCRM is a full-fledged management system that handles everything from student and course details (with full CRUD) to enrollments, grading (mirroring VIT Bhopal's official system!), and even data backups. It's all managed right from your console.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Java Platforms: SE vs. ME vs. EE

Java isn't one-size-fits-all. Here‚Äôs a quick comparison to show where this project (a Java SE app) fits in.

| Aspect               | Java ME (Micro Edition)         | Java SE (Standard Edition)    | Java EE (Enterprise Edition)       |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Target Platform** | Embedded devices, IoT, sensors  | Desktop & console applications| Enterprise-grade web applications  |
| **API Scope** | A small subset of core APIs     | The core Java features        | Extended APIs for web & services   |
| **Memory Footprint** | Tiny (~MBs)                     | Medium (~10s of MBs)          | Large (100+ MBs)                   |
| **Use Cases** | Old mobile apps, smart cards    | **This Project**, desktop tools | Web services, large-scale systems  |
| **Key Technologies** | MIDP, CLDC                      | Swing, JavaFX, Core APIs      | Servlets, JSP, EJB, JPA            |

## üîß The Core Trio: JDK vs. JRE vs. JVM

Here‚Äôs how the Java ecosystem components stack up.

### JVM (Java Virtual Machine)
* **What it is**: The magic box that actually runs your compiled Java bytecode.
* **Its Superpower**: It provides platform independence, fulfilling the "Write Once, Run Anywhere" promise.
* **Inside**: It has a class loader, memory areas (like the heap and stack), and an execution engine.

### JRE (Java Runtime Environment)
* **What it is**: The software package that provides everything needed to *run* a Java application.
* **Inside**: It contains the **JVM** and the core Java libraries.
* **Who needs it**: End-users who just want to run a Java program need the JRE.

### JDK (Java Development Kit)
* **What it is**: The full toolkit for *developing* Java applications.
* **Inside**: It contains the entire **JRE** plus development tools like the compiler (`javac`), archiver (`jar`), and documentation generator (`javadoc`).
* **Who needs it**: Developers need the JDK to write, compile, and debug Java code.

**In short: `JDK ‚äÉ JRE ‚äÉ JVM`**

## üìñ Connecting the Dots: Syllabus to Source Code

This project was built to be a practical application of key computer science concepts. Here‚Äôs a map of syllabus topics to their implementation in the CCRM codebase.

| Syllabus Topic            | Where to Find It                                   | File / Class / Method                                   |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **OOP Principles** | The core data models of the application.           | All classes in `src/edu/ccrm/domain/`                   |
| **Encapsulation** | All domain classes protect their state.            | Private fields with public getters/setters.             |
| **Inheritance** | A `Student` is a specialized type of `Person`.     | `Person.java`, `Student.java`                           |
| **Polymorphism** | Different classes provide their own search logic.  | `Searchable.java` interface and its implementations.    |
| **Abstract Classes** | The `Person` class provides a template.            | `Person.java` is declared as `abstract`.                |
| **Interfaces** | Defines contracts for searching and saving.        | `Searchable.java`, `Persistable.java`                   |
| **Enums** | For type-safe grades and semesters.                | `Grade.java`, `Semester.java`                           |
| **Exception Handling** | Graceful error handling for invalid operations.    | All classes in `src/edu/ccrm/exceptions/`               |
| **File I/O (NIO.2)** | Reading from and writing to files.                 | `FileService.java`                                      |
| **Collections Framework** | Managing lists of students, courses, etc.          | All service classes (e.g., `StudentService.java`).      |
| **Stream API** | Powerful, declarative data processing.             | `search()` and `getTopStudents()` methods.              |
| **Lambda Expressions** | Concise, functional-style code.                    | Used with streams for filtering, mapping, etc.          |
| **Design Patterns** | For robust and maintainable code architecture.     | `AppConfig.java` (Singleton), `Course.java` (Builder).  |
| **Recursion** | For operations that involve traversing directories.| `RecursionUtil.java` (e.g., for backups).               |
| **Date/Time API** | Handling timestamps accurately.                    | `LocalDateTime` used for `submitted_at` fields.         |

## üß™ How to Enable Assertions

Assertions are a great way to catch bugs during development by verifying assumptions in your code. They are disabled by default.

### Enable Assertions via Command Line:
Use the `-ea` (enable assertions) flag when you run the application.
```bash
java -ea -cp bin edu.ccrm.cli.ccrm_main
```

### Enable Assertions in Eclipse:
1.  Go to **Run ‚Üí Run Configurations...**.
2.  Select your `CCRMMain` launch configuration under *Java Application*.
3.  Go to the **Arguments** tab.
4.  In the **VM arguments** box, type `-ea`.
5.  Click **Apply**, then **Run**.

### Sample Assertion in the Code:
Here‚Äôs how assertions are used to enforce rules before processing a student object.
```java
public void validateStudent(Student student) {
    // Ensure the student object itself isn't null
    assert student != null : "Student object cannot be null";

    // Ensure the ID is present
    assert student.getId() != null && !student.getId().isEmpty() : "Student ID is required";

    // Validate the registration number format with a regex
    assert student.getRegNo().matches("^24BCE\\d{5}$") : "Invalid registration number format";
}
```
