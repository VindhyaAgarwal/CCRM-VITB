##  Project Deep Dive

### Connecting the Dots: Syllabus to Source Code
This project serves as a practical application of key computer science concepts. Here‚Äôs where you can find them in the codebase:

| Syllabus Topic            | Where to Find It                                   | File / Class / Method                                   |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **OOP Principles** | The core data models of the application.           | All classes in `src/edu/ccrm/domain/`                   |
| **Encapsulation** | All domain classes protect their state.            | Private fields with public getters/setters.             |
| **Inheritance** | A `Student` is a specialized type of `Person`.     | `Person.java`, `Student.java`                           |
| **Polymorphism** | Different classes provide their own search logic.  | `Searchable.java` interface and its implementations.    |
| **Abstract Classes** | The `Person` class provides a template.            | `Person.java` is declared as `abstract`.                |
| **Interfaces** | Defines contracts for searching and saving.        | `Searchable.java`, `Persistable.java`                   |
| **File I/O (NIO.2)** | Reading from and writing to files.                 | `FileService.java`                                      |
| **Collections Framework** | Managing lists of students, courses, etc.          | All service classes (e.g., `StudentService.java`).      |
| **Stream API & Lambdas** | Powerful, declarative data processing.             | `search()` and `getTopStudents()` methods.              |
| **Design Patterns** | For robust and maintainable code architecture.     | `AppConfig.java` (Singleton), `Course.java` (Builder).  |
| **Recursion** | For operations that involve traversing directories.| `RecursionUtil.java` (e.g., for backups).               |

###  How to Enable Assertions
Assertions are great for catching bugs by verifying assumptions in your code. They are disabled by default.

* **Via Command Line**: Use the `-ea` flag.
    ```bash
    java -ea -cp bin edu.ccrm.cli.ccrm_main
    ```
* **In Eclipse**:
    1. Go to **Run ‚Üí Run Configurations...**.
    2. Select your `ccrm_main` launch configuration.
    3. Go to the **Arguments** tab and in the **VM arguments** box, type `-ea`.
    4. Click **Apply**, then **Run**.

##  Java Concepts Explained 

Let's learn more about the Java ecosystem:-

### A Quick Trip Down Java Lane
This project stands on the shoulders of giants! Here's a quick look at how Java has evolved.
* **1995**: Java 1.0 is released.
* **1998**: Java 1.2 introduces the game-changing Collections Framework.
* **2004**: Java 5 brings generics, autoboxing, and annotations.
* **2014**: **Java 8** revolutionizes the language with Lambda expressions and the Stream API.
* **2018**: **Java 11 LTS** arrives with a new HTTP client and the `var` keyword.
* **2021**: **Java 17 LTS** is released, featuring sealed classes and enhanced pattern matching.
* **2023**: **Java 21 LTS** introduces virtual threads, pushing performance forward.

### The Core Trio: JDK vs. JRE vs. JVM
* **JVM (Java Virtual Machine)**: The engine that runs your compiled Java code. It's the magic that makes "Write Once, Run Anywhere" possible.
* **JRE (Java Runtime Environment)**: Everything needed to *run* a Java application (JVM + Core Libraries). This is what end-users need.
* **JDK (Java Development Kit)**: The full toolkit for *developing* Java applications (JRE + Tools like `javac`). This is what developers need.
    > In short: **JDK ‚äÉ JRE ‚äÉ JVM**

### Java Platforms: SE vs. ME vs. EE
| Aspect               | Java SE (Standard Edition)    | Java ME (Micro Edition)         | Java EE (Enterprise Edition)       |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **What It's For** | Desktop & console applications| Embedded devices, IoT, sensors  | Enterprise-grade web applications  |
| **Example** | **This Project**, desktop tools    | Old mobile apps, smart cards    | Web services, large-scale systems  |
